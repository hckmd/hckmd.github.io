## Day 11

### Thursday 8th November (Kyoto and Otsu)

#### Day 

We rented bicycles from a shop near our AirBnB and rode a bit around Kyoto.
A lot of streets in Kyoto are narrow and helmets are not mandatory there - so luckily I did not run into anyone or anything ðŸ˜….

Riding around Kyoto was a lot of fun and one of my highlights of the trip.
Rode along the Kamo River... wish we had time to do more.

We went to some temple, saw lots of animals, walked towards Mt.. didn't make it the full way.

Had to return bikes.. got back..
