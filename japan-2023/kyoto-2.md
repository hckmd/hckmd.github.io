We rented bicycles from a shop near our AirBnB and rode a bit around Kyoto.
A lot of streets in Kyoto are narrow and helmets are not mandatory to wear there - so luckily I did not run into anyone or anything ðŸ˜….

Riding around Kyoto was a lot of fun and one of my highlights of the trip.
We rode along a path on the side of the Kamo River, which was easy to ride along and had great views.
We rode to the west, to the Fushimi Inari shrine and parked our bikes near there.

There were a lot of shrines in this area and we walked through the [Senbon Torii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushimi_Inari-taisha#Senbon_Torii){:target="_blank"}, which are rows of many torii gates (there are around 800 of these gates in total).
We saw a fair few cats and birds as we walked towards the summit of Mount Inari. 
We didn't make it all the way to the summit, as we had to get back to the shop to return the bikes we had rented.
I wish we had had more time (maybe an extra day) to ride more around Kyoto and see more of the sights there.

In the evening we went to Otsu, which is a coastal city about 20 minutes train out of Kyoto.
Ben had found an event at a dance club called [Club Move](http://www.club-move.com/){:target="_blank"} called CLUB de JPOP, where there was a bunch of local DJs playing mostly J-Pop and J-Rock music.
There was also someone making and selling hot pot, which we were (graciously) given for free.

We sat at the bar, had some drinks and watched the DJs. 
The owner of the club told us that the club had been around for 26 years and he had spent some time in New York when he was younger.

We had a lot of fun watching the sets and Ben had a bit of a dance with the locals there.
We left through one of the last DJ's sets, as we had to get a train back to Kyoto.

## Day 12

<span class="day-details">Where: Kyoto and Otsu</span>

#### Day

This day was one of only a couple of days where there was some rain - most of the days on our trip were clear and sunny.
We took the Shinkansen from Kyoto to Hiroshima, which was about an hour and a half trip.

We went to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum around lunchtime, which was an amazing museum (but obviously very confronting and solemn).

After walking around the area near the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, including seeing the Atomic Bomb Dome up close, we walked to the Hiroshima Castle (about a 15 minute walk).

The Hiroshima Castle was reconstructed in 1958, after being destroyed in the atomic bombings in 1945. 
The castle and surrounding gardens were beautiful.
There was an interesting museum inside the castle, and the mascot for the Castle was very cute (shown in an image above).
The view from the top of the castle was also excellent, although it was dark by the time we got there and it would have been a much nicer view during the day.

We were tired and needed to get back to our AirBnB in Kyoto, so we headed back towards the station and got the Shinkansen.
When we got back to Kyoto, we had a quick look at the Yodabashi Camera Multimedia store in Kyoto, which is huge and has an assortment of electronics (including appliances, phones, speakers, headphones, instruments etc).
The store was only open for another 10-15 minutes when we got there and there won't many people around.
One guy was playing piano extremely well, which you can hear in the video above.
After that store closed, we tried to find some dinner but couldn't seem to find any places open for food in that area at that time (around 9pm on a Friday!) and so we ended up settling on McDonalds for dinner.
