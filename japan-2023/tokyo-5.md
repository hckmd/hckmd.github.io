Our last couple of days in Japan were in Tokyo, since we were flying out from Tokyo-Haneda airport on Monday the 13th.
We took the Shinkansen from Kyoto to Tokyo in the morning, and ended up spending some time in Akihabara as we couldn't check in to our AirBnB until the afternoon.

Ben hadn't been to Akihabara before, so I showed him some of the different stores there.

We went to the AirBnB in Shinjuku, which was a larger unit than the other places we'd stayed at.
The AirBnB was in a great location (very close to the main part of Shinjuku) and, for the first time in the trip, Ben and I had our own rooms.

After settling into the AirBnB, we headed into [Moon Romantic](https://www.moonromantic.com/){:target="_blank"} (a cool music venue in Minato city) to see the Japanese math-rock band [Paranoid Void](https://www.paranoidvoid.com/){:target="_blank"}.
We met up with Ben's friends Toby and Darcy at the venue.
Darcy had been travelling around Japan for a couple of weeks, had found about the gig through Instagram and (luckily) told Ben about it.
Paranoid Void were doing a solo show no supports and their (excellent) set was a bit over an hour with no breaks.
We bought some merch - Ben got a tshirt and I got some CDs and stickers.

One of my friends from Sydney, Ray, was in Tokyo for work and I went to meet him for drinks at the Golden Gai in Shinjuku.
Ben, Darcy and Toby headed into Shibuya for drinks, bowling and other shenanigans.

The Golden Gai is a district in Shinjuku with lots and lots of bars in narrow alleys.
Ray had been to Tokyo a few times before and was fairly familiar with the area, so he led the way as we looked around to find a bar to try.
We tried one of the bars (I can't remember what it was called or where it was), had a few drinks and caught up.
He recommended a few places in Tokyo to check out, including the Tsujiki Fish Market and Kappabashi, which we went to the next day.

After our catch-up, I headed back towards the AirBnB (which was only about a 10 minute walk!).
Ray had mentioned the 9% (alcoholic) Strong Zero drinks when we caught up, which he was surprised I hadn't tried on the trip yet.
I decided to try one that night as it was our second last night in Japan, buying one from a 7/11 (along with some socks, snacks and a coffee for the next morning), on the way back to the AirBnB. 
It was very sweet - I could hardly taste the alcohol (even though it was very strong at 9%).

#### Morning

This day was our last full day in Japan, as we flew back to Sydney the next day.
In the monrning, we went to the Tsukiji Outer Market, which was about half an hour from Shinjuku.

The market was bustling with people and there were lots of food options at the markets' stalls.
We had a walk through the markets and tried a variety of foods - including prawns, wagyu beef and egg rolls.

We saw a sign for a coffee shop that made us laugh (shown in the images above, it said: "could you go to the second floor, please") and I felt like a coffee, so we headed upstairs to the coffee shop.
Unfortunately, the coffee shop was closed but we ended up stumbling into the photo exhibition for a book written by Kei Sugiyama, a designer and the Creative Director of [United Design](https://www.united-design.co.jp/en/index.html){:target="_blank"}.
Kei was at the exhibition and, with help from another person (possibly his partner? We were not sure) who knew some English, explained that the book was about the old site of the Tsukiji fish markets.
At the old market, a large open-air warehouse, fish would be brought directly into the markets and auctioneds to customers.
The markets were accessible to everyone the purchased fish would often be cut up in front of the customers.
As of 2018, the old site closed and the processing of the fish is now done at the Toyosu market in the Kōtō ward, Tokyo.
The facilities there are not open air and the food safety standards there are a lot better because there is less risk of contamination.
People can still visit the Toyosu Fish Market and eat at restarauants there but it is a lot different to the old Tsukiji markets.
However, the food stalls and restaraunts in the Tsujiki Outer Market are likely to source their seafood from Toyosu - they just don't auction off and cut up fish there.

Kei's book focuses on the old Tsukiji Fish Market site and has many black and white photos, design plans and explanatory text about the history of the site.
He seemed to very nostalgic for the old site, where it seemed that the fish was sold more fresh - pretty much directly from being caught and where there was more of a sense of community.
There was an interesting inscription on one of the posters of the wall of the exhibition which summarised his thoughts on the old market, in the collapsible section below.

        <div class="card card-body my-2">
            <p>A structure with a fan-shaped form that accommodated the original mail transportation system. Planned traffic flow lines moving toward the center of the building in the order in which tasks were performed.</p>
            <p>A unique location within walking distance of the city center, adjacent to the sea and a historic garden Shinto shrines, festivals, and close ties to the traditional local community. A work environment that enabled adjustments and reworking. Regular reallocation of retail spaces to maintain fairness. A place where men and women of all ages could work in different roles. Elements that comprised a town, such as banks, post offices, clinics, cafeterias, kiosks, and shrines.</p>
            <p>Methods of avoiding crises in internal market traffic that varied organically throughout the day. People who were strongly motivated by <i>giri</i> (social obligations) and <i>ninjo</i> (human feelings) with no regard for profits.</p>
            <p>A town that AI that never entered.</p>
            <p>In 2023, it has been 100 years since the Nihonbashi Fish Market was destroyed by the Great Kanto Earthquake. Now; five years after relocated to Toyosu, we once again reexamine the Tsukiji Fish Market. This book is by no means telling a nostalgic story. On the contrary, it is primarily a visual document focusing on the speed and the components of the evolution of the Tsukiji Market, which is a neighborhood with an atmosphere that has changed over the years from one of rational modern architecture to one of picturesque nostalgia. Undoubtedly, the sort of "humanistic community" that once existed here will be needed again in some future time.</p>

Ben bought a copy of Kei's book, which he signed, before we left and went for another walk around the markets.
We had some sushi at a restaraunt in the markets, which was expensive compared to other places we had been on our trip.
However, the fish was very fresh and tasty, and this probably my favourite sushi of the trip.

#### Afternoon and Evening

After lunch, we went to Kappabashi (also known as *Kitchen Town*), a street in Asakusa that has lots of shops that sell kitchenware and restaurant supplies.
I had mentioned to Ray that I was considering getting a knife (for cooking) and he recommended checking out a few shops there.

I hadn't researched much about knives before going to Japan and wasn't really sure I needed one that much.
In the end, I didn't get one but we had a look around the shops, which were pretty interesting.
There were shops that sold fake food (for restaurant displays) and one even sold a pizza hat (shown in an above image), which I was tempted to buy (but decided against it).

We bought a couple of random things from a shop in Kappabashi, including some bowls and chopstick holders, but did not make any big purchases.

We then went back to Shinjuku for the afternoon and did some shopping.
I picked up some CDs for a band ([Special Others](http://www.specialothers.com/index.php){:target="_blank"}) who I had heard in a bathroom in a bar in Shibuya we had been to in the first week of our trip.

After doing some shopping, we took a quick walk around the Golden Gai, as Ben hadn't been there before.
It was quiet there and we had an early morning the next day, so we decided to not have a drink and call it a night early.

### Monday 13th November 

We had an early morning this day around 4:30am, as we didn't want to miss our flight.
After missing a train to the airport, we decided to get a taxi the rest of the way.
We flew back to Sydney, I got home and Ben drove back to Maitland.
