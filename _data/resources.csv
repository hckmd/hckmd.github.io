Learning to Teach Coding Resources,List of Websites,"I have collated a list of high quality resources for learning Coding that I commonly use, or recommend, in the professional learning programs that we run. This list of resources will be most relevant and useful to teachers that have to teach Coding as part of New South Wales syllabuses. However, the resources will still be relevant to teachers in other states and countries. These resources could also be helpful for parents who have children that want to learn more about Coding.",resource_coding_list_for_teachers.png,teachers-learning-coding-list
