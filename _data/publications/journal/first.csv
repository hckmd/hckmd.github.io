to-assess,To Assess or Not to Assess,To Assess or Not to Assess: Tensions Negotiated in Six Years of Teaching Teachers about Computational Thinking,Informatics in Education,September 2018,17,2,<strong>Daniel Hickmott</strong> and Elena Prieto-Rodriguez,"Coding and computational thinking have recently become compulsory skills in many school systems globally. Teaching these new skills presents a challenge for many teachers. A notable example of professional development designed using Constructionist principles to address this challenge is ScratchEd. Upon reflecting on her experiences designing and running ScratchEd, Karen Brennan identified five tensions faced by professional development providers, and proposed that these tensions could be used for scrutinising and critiquing professional development. In this paper we analyse, through the lens of Brennan's tensions, the process we have followed to design, evaluate and improve professional development. We argue that while we have experienced the same tensions, the extent to which we assess learning is a new tension that extends those identified by Brennan. There are strong reasons to assess teachers' knowledge, however, quantitative measures of learning could be at odds with Constructionism: as Papert argued in Mindstorms, constructionist educators should study their learning environments as anthropologists. Consequently, we have called this new tension the tension between anthropology and assessment.",publication_to_assess.png,Informatics in Education Website,https://www.mii.lt/informatics_in_education/htm/infedu.2018.12.htm
scoping-review,Scoping Review,A Scoping Review of Studies on Computational Thinking in K-12 Mathematics Classrooms,Digital Experiences in Mathematics Education,April 2018,4,1,"<strong>Daniel Hickmott</strong>, Elena Prieto-Rodriguez and Kathryn Holmes","Since the 1960s, a few, yet very influential, educational researchers have investigated how computer programming can be used to foster mathematics learning. However, since the term ‘computational thinking’ was popularised by Jeannette Wing in 2006, the number of studies in this area has grown substantially. In this article, we present a systematic analysis of literature linking mathematics education to computational thinking in an attempt to quantify the breadth and depth of existing work in the area. Our analysis indicates that many studies: (1) originate from computer science academics rather than education experts; (2) involve mathematics but mainly concentrate on teaching programming skills; (3) present small-scale research designs on self-reported attitudes or beliefs; (4) rarely deal with concepts in mathematical domain areas such as probability, statistics, measurement or functions. Thus, we conclude that there are opportunities for rigorous research designs reporting on observable learning outcomes, explicitly targeting mathematics, conducted by multidisciplinary teams, and focusing on less-explored domain areas. We believe that these opportunities should be investigated, in order to provide a broader evidence base for developing meaningful digital learning experiences in mathematics for school-aged children.",publication_scoping_review.png,SpringerLink Website,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40751-017-0038-8
