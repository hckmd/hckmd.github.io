scratchmaths-pilot,Using coding to teach mathematics: results of a pilot project,Integrated Education for the Real World: 5th International STEM in Education,November 2018,"Brisbane, Australia","Kathryn Holmes, Elena Prieto-Rodriguez, <strong>Daniel Hickmott</strong> and Nathan Berger","The Australian Curriculum: Digital Technologies provides an opportunity for teachers to integrate coding and computational thinking within their STEM teaching practices. However, this opportunity has proven to be a challenge for many teachers, as their self-efficacy with respect to teaching these new skills is often low. This research explores the implementation of a professional development program that focussed on the integration of coding and computational thinking within the teaching of mathematics in primary school classrooms. In particular, we study changes in teacher self-efficacy with regards to coding and computational thinking before and after participating in the program. Using the validated Teachers’ Self-Efficacy in Computational Thinking (TSECT) instrument as well as focus group data, we analyse the experiences of 15 primary school teachers in New South Wales, Australia. We conclude that the program, based on the ScratchMaths resources developed in the UK, was successful in improving teachers’ self-efficacy towards both computational thinking and the integration of mathematics and coding. Our qualitative analysis of the focus group conversations also highlighted teachers’ positive perceptions of student engagement and the need to make the mathematics concepts underpinning the ScratchMaths modules more explicit.",International STEM in Education 2018 Website,https://stem-in-ed2018.com.au/proceedings-2/
serious-games-analytics,Exploring Play-Learners’ Analytics in a Serious Game for Literacy Improvement,Joint International Conference on Serious Games 2016,September 2016,"Brisbane, Australia","Shamus P. Smith, <strong>Daniel Hickmott</strong>, Erica Southgate, Ross Bille and Liz Stephens","The collection and analysis of analytics incorporated into serious games provides researchers with objective data on player behavior related to serious game design elements and learning. Such analytics offer insights about play-learners engagement that is not possible to capture through traditional techniques. Visualization of learning behavior data can allow for a comparison between the pedagogical intent of the game design and the play-learners actual behavior within the serious game. This paper describes the use of game-play logs to identify pathways through gaming content in a serious game app for literacy improvement. The paper describes the technical aspects of processing game-play logs and their transformation into visualizations, and considers how these visualizations can be used to explore play-learner behavior in relation to the pedagogical intent of activities embedded in the serious game app. ",SpringerLink Website,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45841-0_2
improving-soft-skills,Improving undergraduate soft skills using m-learning and serious games,"IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering 2015",December 2015,"Zhuhai, China ","Shamus P. Smith, <strong>Daniel Hickmott</strong>, Ross Bille, Elizabeth Burd, Erica Southgate and Liz Stephens ","Soft skills such as effective communication are becoming increasingly important for engineering graduates. Employers prize excellent written and oral abilities and literacy proficiency. High levels of academic literacy can significantly improve students' success in their university study. Traditional approaches to literacy improvement can limit student engagement. However, mobile learning and the use of smart phone apps present new opportunities to support literacy education. This paper describes current work exploring the use of apps, as serious games, to improve literacy in undergraduate students and outlines initial results from a cross-discipline evaluation of an m-learning literacy app.",IEEE Xplore Website,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7386049
