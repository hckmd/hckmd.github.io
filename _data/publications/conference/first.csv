constructionism-5-years,Constructionist Experiences in Teacher Professional Development: A Tale of Five Years,Constructionism 2018,August 2018,"Vilnius, Lithuania",<strong>Daniel Hickmott</strong> and Elena Prieto-Rodriguez,"Computational thinking and coding have recently become compulsory elements in the Australian K-8 curriculum that should be taught using ‘authentic learning challenges’  (ACARA, 2018a). However, very few teachers, particularly in the primary school setting, have been schooled on computational thinking or coding and rarely possess pedagogies to teach them authentically. A range of professional development opportunities are currently being offered to impart this knowledge, both for content and pedagogy. In this paper, we provide an account of the evolution we have experienced when designing and improving professional development workshops for teachers in coding and computational thinking. We reflect on our challenges and successes, and attest that it was only after ‘discovering’ Constructionism in late 2015 that we have been able to prepare activities that truly emulate the authentic learning experiences that teachers are required to use in their classrooms.",Constructionism 2018 Website,http://www.constructionism2018.fsf.vu.lt/proceedings/
apostrophe-power,Building apostrophe power: lessons learnt for serious games development,Interactive Entertainment 2016,February 2016,"Canberra, Australia","<strong>Daniel Hickmott</strong>, Shamus P. Smith, Ross Bille, Elizabeth Burd, Liz Stephens and Erica Southgate","There is increasing interest in the application of serious games for learning. Growth in the take-up of digital devices, e.g. smartphones and tablets, and their use for gaming provides new opportunities for mobile learning (m-learning). A serious game m-learning app for improving adult learners' apostrophe usage, called Apostrophe Power, has been developed. The research team, which consisted of software engineers and educationalists, encountered a number of discipline spanning issues while designing and developing this m-learning app.

This paper overviews the issues encountered, the recommendations from recent literature and how the issues were ultimately addressed, exemplified in a case study. These lessons learnt offer insight for serious game development and highlight practical solutions for m-learning apps involving interdisciplinary teams.",ACM Digital Library,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2843475
