    <h2>Coding & STEM 4 Schools</h2>
    <p>
        The Coding & STEM 4 Schools (CS4S) program has involved running a variety of professional learning opportunities at
        the University of Newcastle, since 2013. The focus of the opportunities, which have included 2-day workshops and 
        blended learning programs, has been on supporting K-12 teachers in integrating computer 
        coding into their teaching.
