## Tutoring Experience
{: .content-subhead }

I have 5 years of experience introducing adult learners (100+ teachers) to Coding through the [Computer Science 4 Schools workshops](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/cs4s) that I help run at the University of Newcastle (UON).
I have also been a course demonstrator for [SENG3400](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/course/SENG3400) at the University of Newcastle and have also helped friends study for a variety of courses at UON (such as [SENG2200](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/course/SENG2200) and [COMP1140](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/course/COMP1140)) through one-on-one tutoring sessions.

I also keep up to date with the latest innovations and best practices of Computing Education, as it is my main research area.

If you have any questions about experience teaching certain subjects/concepts, please send me an email at [daniel.hickmott@gmail.com](mailto:daniel.hickmott@gmail.com).
