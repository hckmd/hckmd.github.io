      <h2 class="content-subhead">Projects</h2>
      <p>
        There are 2 main projects that I have been involved in at the University of Newcastle:
        <i>Computer Science 4 Schools</i> and <i>Literacy Apps</i>.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content-subhead">Computer Science 4 Schools</h3>
      <img class="content-img" src="images/cs4s_scratch.png" alt="Scratch Example"></img>
      <p>
        Since 2013, I have worked with academics from the School of Education and the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer 
        Science to organise and run Computer Science Professional Development workshops for teachers, titled <i>Computer Science 4 Schools</i
        >. The purpose
        of these workshops, which are developed in partnership with Google, is to help prepare teachers for the recently endorsed Digital Technologies 
        Curriculum, and to give them the knowledge and tools to help them
        inspire the next generation of <i>Computational Thinkers</i>. During these workshops I have prepared and presented tutorials, organised scheduling and catering, and worked with my supervisor to design surveys to collect workshop feedback.

        Most of the activities that I have developed for these workshops are licenced under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Licence.</a>
        For example, <a href="https://cs4s.github.io/intro-2017/day1/coding/Coding%20in%20Scratch%20Activity%20-%20Fundamental%20Coding%20Concepts.docx">this activity introduces fundamental Coding concepts in Scratch.</a>
        You can access all of the resources I have created for the recent workshops <a href="https://cs4s.github.io/">from the UON CS4S website</a>.

      <h3 class="content-subhead">Literacy Apps</h3>
      <img class="content-img" src="images/literacy_apps.jpg" alt="Sentence Hero app"></img>
      <p>
        In 2015 I worked with a team of educators and software engineers to develop two mobile learning apps, one titled <i>Apostrophe Power</i> and the other titled <i>Sentence Hero</i>. These apps
        are games which can be used by students to improve their literacy skills. My role in this project was to develop the apps for iOS devices,
        while another team member developed the apps for Android devices. I used the Swift programming language, along with the SpriteKit game development framework to develop these apps. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The iOS versions of these apps are available as free downloads on the App Store:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/AP">Apostrophe Power</a></li>
          <li><a href="/SH">Sentence Hero</a></li>
        </ul>
