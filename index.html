      <h2 class="content-subhead">About</h2>

      <p>
        I am a recently graduated Software Engineer from Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.
        I am passionate about software and problem solving, especially when it involves working with team members from different disciplines and knowledge areas. 
        I have worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Newcastle (UoN) since 2013. For most of 2015 I worked at UoN on a full-time basis on projects
        in the areas of Computer Science, Education and Psychology. 
        In 2013 and 2014 I worked at UoN while studying and working part-time as an Undergraduate Software Engineer.
      </p>

      <p>I have two main research interests which I have worked on while working as a Research Assistant at UoN:<p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The design, development and evaluation of Serious Games for learning
        </li>
        <li>
          The study of professional development approaches for 
          <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/curriculum/f-10?layout=1">Digital Technologies</a> teachers
          </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I am hoping to continue working in these research areas, and am currently considering pursuing a research higher degree (RHD) at UoN part-time 
        while working as a Software Engineer and/or Research Assistant.
        My aim in completing an RHD is to not only work on a research topic I am passionate about, but also to develop my skills in researching, data 
        collection and quantitative analysis - which I will be able to apply to domains outside of these research areas.

      <h2 class="content-subhead">Blog</h2>

      I have blogged about some things that I find interesting <a href="http://hickyau.blogspot.com.au/">here.</a>

      <h2 class="content-subhead">Projects</h2>

      There are 2 main projects that I have been involved in outside of my studies and professional experience: <b>Literacy Apps</b> and <b>Computer Science 4 Schools</b>.

      <h3 class="content-subhead">Literacy Apps</h3>
      <p>
        In 2015 I worked with a team of educationalists and software engineers to develop two mobile learning apps, one titled <i>Apostrophe Power</i> and the other titled <i>Sentence Hero</i>. These apps
        are games which can be used by students to improve their literacy skills. My role in this project was to develop the apps for iOS devices,
        while another team member developed the apps for Android devices. I used Swift, along with the SpriteKit game development framework to develop these apps. The first of these apps,
        <i>Apostrophe Power</i>, can be downloaded <a href="/AP">here</a> for free.
      </p>

      <h3 class="content-subhead">Computer Science 4 Schools</h3>
      <p>
        In 2013, 2014 and 2015 I assisted in the organisation and running of Computer Science Professional Development workshops for teachers titled <i>Computer Science 4 Schools</i>. The purpose
        of these workshops, which are funded by Google, is to help prepare teachers for the recently endorsed Digital Technologies Curriculum, and to give them the knowledge and tools to help them
        inspire the next generation of computational thinkers. During these workshops, I have prepared and presented tutorials, performed general administrative tasks and have assisted in the collection of data and survey design for workshop feedback.
