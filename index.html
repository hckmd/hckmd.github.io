      <h2 class="content-subhead">About</h2>

      <p>
        I am currently a Master of Philosophy (Education) student at the University of Newcastle. 
        I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (Software) degree at the University of Newcastle in 2014. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about software development and technical problem solving, especially when it involves working with team members 
        from different disciplines and specialisations. I have worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Newcastle (UoN) since 
        2013. For most of 2015 I worked at UoN on a full-time basis on projects in the areas of Computer Science, Education and Psychology. 
        In 2013 and 2014 I worked on a casual basis at UoN while studying and working part-time as an Undergraduate Software Engineer.
      </p>

      <p>I have two main research interests, that I have worked on while at UoN:<p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The design, development and evaluation of Serious Games for learning
        </li>
        <li>
          The study of professional learning approaches for 
          <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/curriculum/f-10?layout=1">Digital Technologies</a> teachers
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The research area my Higher Degree by Research (HDR) work is centred on is the evaluation of professional learning opportunities for Digital Technologies teachers. I am working on this full-time, as of February 2016.
        I am currently a Masters by Research student, but am planning to upgrade to a Doctor of Philosophy following my conformation in March 2017.
        After completing this degree I am hoping to continue working in Computer Science Education, as a University researcher or in an organisation that provides adult education.
      </p>

      <h2 class="content-subhead">Projects</h2>

      <p>
        There are 2 main projects that I have been involved in at UoN:
        <i>Literacy Apps</i> and <i>Computer Science 4 Schools</i>.
      </p>

      <h3 class="content-subhead">Literacy Apps</h3>

      <p>
        In 2015 I worked with a team of educators and software engineers to develop two mobile learning apps, one titled <i>Apostrophe Power</i> and the other titled <i>Sentence Hero</i>. These apps
        are games which can be used by students to improve their literacy skills. My role in this project was to develop the apps for iOS devices,
        while another team member developed the apps for Android devices. I used the Swift programming language, along with the SpriteKit game development framework to develop these apps. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The iOS versions of these apps are available as free downloads on the App Store:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/AP">Apostrophe Power</a></li>
          <li><a href="/SH">Sentence Hero</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 class="content-subhead">Computer Science 4 Schools</h3>
      <p>
        In 2013 - 2016, I worked with academics from the School of Education and the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer 
        Science to organise and run Computer Science Professional Development workshops for teachers, titled <i>Computer Science 4 Schools</i
        >. The purpose
        of these workshops, which are funded by Google, is to help prepare teachers for the recently endorsed Digital Technologies 
        Curriculum, and to give them the knowledge and tools to help them
        inspire the next generation of computational thinkers. During these workshops I have prepared and presented tutorials, organised scheduling and catering, and worked with my supervisor to design surveys to collect workshop feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have uploaded two step-by-step tutorials that I wrote for the workshops in 2015. The first is from the Advanced workshop in July, 
        and involves building a "Student Register" <a href="cs4s_advanced_appengine.pdf">web app with AppEngine and JavaScript.</a> The second is a tutorial from the Introductory workshop in November that involves making a game, titled <i>Cookie Bird</i>, <a href="cs4s_introductory_scratch.pdf">in Scratch.</a>
